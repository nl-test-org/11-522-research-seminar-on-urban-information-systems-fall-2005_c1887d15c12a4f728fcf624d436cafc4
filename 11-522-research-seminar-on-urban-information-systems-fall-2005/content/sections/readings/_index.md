| 1 | Introduction and Organizing Class Presentations | &nbsp; |
| 2 | City Knowledge: An Emergent Information Infrastructure for Sustainable Urban Maintenance, Management and Planning - Joe Ferreira and Fabio Carrera | In preparation for this discussion, we suggest that you read or skim the following:  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}For a full explanation of the concept of City Knowledge, you should skim Fabio Carrera's [PhD Dissertation](http://users.wpi.edu/%7Ecarrera/MIT/dissertation.html) especially Part I and Part V and you should ready more carefully Part IV.  {{< br >}}Part I ([PDF](http://users.wpi.edu/%7Ecarrera/MIT/Dissertation/Part%20I.pdf))  {{< br >}}Part V ([PDF](http://users.wpi.edu/%7Ecarrera/MIT/Dissertation/Part%20V.pdf))  {{< br >}}Part IV ([PDF](http://users.wpi.edu/%7Ecarrera/MIT/Dissertation/Part%20IV.pdf))  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}When it comes to implementing government policies, a school of thought that has been put forward by DUSP faculty, suggests that we focus on the so-called "Five tools of Government Action." A full description of these tools can be found in the book _[Preserving the Built Heritage](https://www.amazon.com/Preserving-Built-Heritage-Tools-Implementation/dp/0874518318)_ edited by our own Mark Schuster and John DeMonchaux. There is a summary of the concepts in the introduction chapter. A shorter version is contained in Policy and Planning with Purpose. (PDF)  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}The concept of "Emergence" features prominently in the City Knowledge approach. If you are interested, we suggest that you read the popular book _Emergence_ by Steven Johnson. You may find the book very stimulating. At the very least should familiarize yourself with the concept by googling "emergence" so you can look at shorter explanations such as the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) entry for the term.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Prof. Ferreira describes middleware applications in his article entitled "Information Technologies that Change Relationships between Low-Income Communities and the Public and Non-profit Agencies that Serve Them" as well as in the MIT/MAPC proposal "Intelligent Middleware for Understanding Neighborhood Markets" a pilot project of the Brookings Institution [Urban Markets Initiative](https://brookings.edu/author/the-urban-markets-initiative-brookings-institution-metropolitan-policy-program/?type=all&paged=1).  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}For recent accounts of the Planning Support Systems that are already in use around the world, you can take a look at Klosterman's recent (2005) guest editorial in Environment and Planning B, as well as to Maguire and Longley's paper on "The emergence of geoportals and their role in spatial data infrastructures." An older, but interesting paper predating City Knowledge is Rubenstein-Montano's Survey of knowledge-based information systems for urban planning.  {{< br >}}Klosterman's Editorial ([PDF](http://www.envplan.com/epb/editorials/b3204ed.pdf))  {{< br >}}Maguire and Longley's Paper  {{< br >}}Rubenstein-Montano, B. "A survey of knowledge-based information systems for urban planning: moving towards knowledge management." _Computers, Environment and Urban Systems_ 24 (2000): 155-172. |
| 3 | Sharing Data and Empowering Communities - Fabio Carrera and Joe Ferreira | Community of Practice 'Wiki' for the "[National Infrastructure for Community Statistics](https://www.brookings.edu/on-the-record/national-infrastructure-for-community-statistics-an-overview/)." (NICS)  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}An overview of the [Urban Markets Initiative (UMI)](https://www.brookings.edu/author/the-urban-markets-initiative-brookings-institution-metropolitan-policy-program/) as discussed in the full-paper version of "[Using Information to Drive Change: New Ways of Moving Markets](https://www.brookings.edu/research/using-information-to-drive-change-new-ways-of-moving-markets/)."  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}The MIT/MAPC proposal that has been funded by the UMI program: "Intelligent Middleware for Understanding Neighborhood Markets."  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}The Urban Institute proposal that has also been funded by the UMI program: "Decision Support Tools To Guide Urban Land Markets."  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Singh, Raj. "Collaborative Urban Information Systems: A Web Services Approach." Chapter 1 of _Dissertation_. MIT, 2004.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}[Google™ Earth](http://earth.google.com/) and [Phil Bradley's Web site](http://www.philb.com/webse.htm) discussing the user-publishing features of GoogleTM Earth. |
